For the second and third laboratory I have contributed with the following aspects:
- State of The Art (2nd lab) - first version before changing the project; writing about Swarm ESB, data confidentiality, user privacy and alternate
resources; also added useful documentation, resources and tools;
- State of the Art (3rd lab) - second version for the current project named iAssistMe, where I have written the introduction in this field,
the articles and books published on this topic so far and the links to useful resources, tools and documentation that will help us develop
the project (Android, RabbitMq, Google Cloud Apis for Android, Google Cloud Agents, Firebase Login etc.);
- Designed a collaboration diagram for all components of the project, where it shows how they interact in order to fulfill a user's request;
- Designed a class diagram for the RabbitMq Pub/Sub Mechanism and how it will be implemented in our project;
It uses two design patterns: Factory and Singleton
