For the second and third labs:
- RISK-ASSESMENT - describing the application requirements, the components of the application,
how it satisfies the requirements, the flow and the risk on each component
- Designed model diagram of prototype components of the application
- Designed model diagram for the smart agents cluster
- Designed collaboration diagram for the transport slice of the project, where it shows how the user requirement
traverses in order to reach the smart agents

For the fourth lab:
- implement LeadAgent design
    -> Design Patterns implemented: 
        - Observable for triggering incoming messages that are subscribed from the first RabbitMQ
        - Singelton for the RabbitMQ connection
        - Factory for forwarding the request and applying adjustment functions if needed
    -> overall flow of the agent using async module and implemented design patterns
