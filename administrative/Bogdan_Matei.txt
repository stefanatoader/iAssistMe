Up until now I have contributed with the following:
- RISK-ASSESMENT - describing the application requirements, the components of the application,
how it satisfies the requirements, the flow and the risk on each component
- Designed model diagram of prototype components of the application
- Designed model diagram for the smart agents cluster
- Designed collaboration diagram for the transport slice of the project, where it shows how the user requirement
traverses in order to reach the smart agents
